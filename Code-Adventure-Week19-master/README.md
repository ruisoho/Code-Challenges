## Printing Values and Types to the Page and the Console

### Intro

Along with learning code, as a developer, it's also important to develop good coding habits, an effective workflow, and a familiarity with some core concepts like basic debugging and logging out your code regularly and often to test its values. Here’s some lightweight practice printing values and types to the page and the console.  In this exercise, you’ll follow a set of instructions to print items to the page and log them to the console to get a glimpse under the hood.

### Instructions

 Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.  If you don't know how to do that, please reach out in Slack.  Next, follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  When you are done, the most recently clicked button should have different styles to indicate that it is "active".

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out in the `#code-adventures` channel in your Slack team.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
