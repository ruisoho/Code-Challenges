# Treehouse FSJS Techdegree Code Adventure - Weekend Coding Homework

## End of the Line

### Intro

Something you'll encounter from time to time as a coder and developer is working with lists that need to be looped over or clicked through repeatedly.  Say you had a set of images to show one at a time on a web page, and your user could click through the images with some arrow buttons.  What would happen when they reached the end of the list?  If you don't account for it, there will likely be an error.  If the "next" button tried to grab the next image, while already on the last image in the list, the project will break.  So let's do some lightweight practice around this.  Your future self will thank you for it.

### Instructions

Starter files have been supplied for you.  Load the index.html file in Chrome and open the dev tools console.  Then follow along with the comments in the js/script.js file to complete this challenge.  When you are done, clicking the buttons on the page should move the X from box to box, looping back to the first box when reaching the end of the list.

If you get stuck or have quesitons, reach out in the #code-adventures channel in Slack.

Best of luck and happy coding!
